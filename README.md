# 🏠 Housing Data Analysis 

This repository contains a dataset (`housing.csv`) used for housing data analysis and potential machine learning tasks such as predicting house prices, understanding housing trends, and exploring correlations between different features.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The `housing.csv` file includes various features commonly associated with housing datasets. These features may include (depending on the dataset):

- Longitude & Latitude
- Housing Median Age
- Total Rooms & Bedrooms
- Population
- Households
- Median Income
- Median House Value
- Proximity to the ocean (Categorical)

> 📌 This dataset is often associated with the **California Housing Prices** dataset, commonly used in ML projects.

## 🚀 Project 

You can build the following projects using this dataset:

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with visualizations
- **Correlation Analysis** among features
- **Predictive Modeling** (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- **Clustering** to segment neighborhoods
- **Geospatial Visualizations**

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

You can use the following Python tools/libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for data visualization
- `scikit-learn` for modeling
